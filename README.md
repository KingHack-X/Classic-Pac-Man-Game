Some history of the Pac-Man Creator: The creator of "Pac-Man," a young game designer named Toru Iwatani, wanted to try something completely different. "When I started drafting up this project in the late 1970s, the arcades were filled with violent games all about killing aliens," said Iwatani, who was working for Japanese games firm Namco at the time.
